This free outdoor dance party will have you shaking off the winter chill while onlookers wonder what the heck you’re doing…because the music can only be heard through headphones!\n\nQuietEvents will provide the headphones and have 3 DJs spinning 3 different genres live: Top 40/EDM, 80s and 90s hits, and Motown/Oldies. Switch between channels as often as you like! Your headphones will glow to show everyone what you’re listening to.\n\nThe dance party (as well as headphone pick-up and drop-off) will be located on the Fountain Terrace, but there are no boundaries – feel free to roam the rest of Winter Carnival! Get a drink at the Southwest Porch or warm up in the Warming Lodge while grooving with your headphones. \n\nFun giveaways courtesy of Southwest Airlines, while supplies last.\n\n*No pre-registration or tickets required, however the number of headphones is limited so participation is while supplies last.\n\nEvent entry open from 6:00pm - 9:00pm. To check out headphones, you must swipe a credit card or debit card. If you fail to return your headphones by 9:15pm on 1/29/2017, your card will be charged $100. Bundle up and dress for the weather - we will be outside! No bag/coat check available.\n\nPhoto: Angelito Jusay Photography","distance":5073,"startTime":"2018-01-28T18:00:00-0500","endTime":"2018-01-28T21:00:00-0500","timezone":"America/New_York","updatedTime":"2018-01-12T22:09:24+0000","timeFromNow":841841,"isCancelled":false,"isDraft":false,"category":"EVENT_PARTY","place":{"id":"61277478605","name":"Bryant Park","location":{"city":"New York","country":"United States","latitude":40.75387292807,"longitude":-73.983886241913,"state":"NY","street":"Between Fifth and Sixth Avenues, 40th and 42nd Streets","zip":"10018"}},"stats":{"attending":199,"declined":0,"maybe":1526,"noreply":306},"distances":{"venue":5073,"event":5073},"venue":{"id":"61277478605","name":"Bryant Park","about":"Located in Midtown Manhattan, Bryant Park is visited by over 6 million people each year and is one of the busiest public spaces in the world.

Highlights include the New York premieres of acclaimed choreographer Darrell Grand Moultrie’s Harlem on My Mind,  George Balanchine’s beloved Valse-Fantaisie and Christopher Wheeldon’s sublime This Bitter Earth, plus the revival of the legendary choreographer Geoffrey Holder’s masterwork Dougla, featuring guest artists and live music.\n\nVision Gala Program\n\nThe Vision Gala on April 4—the 50th anniversary of the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.—reflects on the legacy of Dr. King and the impact of that tragic event. In February 1969, less than a year after King’s death, Arthur Mitchell and his mentor, Karel Shook, founded Dance Theatre of Harlem as a beacon of hope for the youth in the neighborhood where Mitchell grew up. In a few short years, his response to tragedy became a leading dance institution of unparalleled global acclaim. Join Dance Theatre of Harlem for an evening of ballet and special guests celebrating the life-affirming beauty and call to action that grew out of loss.\n\nPrograms subject to change\n\nVision Gala Program\nWed Apr 4 7pm\nBrahms Variations (excerpt) – Robert Garland\nChange – Dianne McIntyre\nPièce d’ Occasion – Robert Garland for the DTH School\nLe Corsaire Pas de Deux – Marius Petipa\nDougla (Company Revival) – Geoffrey Holder\n\nVision Gala Dinner & Awards Ceremony immediately following the performance. \nGala Dinner tickets must be purchased separately.

A 2016-os szezon statisztikája szerint a \"The Illusionists\" produkció érte el a legmagasabb bruttó bevételt egy hét alatt a Marquis and Neil Simon színházakban (Broadway), a Shaftesbury Színházban (West End), a Sydney Operaházban (Sydney, AUS), az Arts Centre Melbourne-ben (Melbourne, AUS) és az Auditorio Nacional-ban (Mexico City, MEX).\n\nA The Illusionists – Direct from Broadway produkció a Szöveg Színház Színházi Egyesület közreműködésével kerül színpadra a Tüskecsarnokban 2018. május első hetében több alkalommal.\n\nA The Illusionists – Direct from Broadway produkció a világ számos nagy színházában elért sikerek után most Budapestre érkezik, hogy rabul ejtse a magyar nézőközönséget. Észbontó látványvilág, káprázat és showműsor az, amelyet a világ hét hihetetlen illúzionistája a színpadra varázsol döbbenetes tehetségével. Tele vicces bűvésztrükkel, halált megvető attrakciókkal és lélegzetelállító mutatványokkal, a The Illusionists – Direct from Broadway elkápráztatja bármilyen korosztályú közönségét. A show-t különlegesen izgalmas és kifinomult varázslatba csomagolták, ahol a közönség észbontó mutatványok mint lebegés, elmében olvasás, eltűnés szemtanúja lesz. A világ jelenleg legkeresettebb mágusai elhozzák a múlt nagy illúzionistáinak – úgy mint Harry Houdini – előadóművészetét és párosítják azt egy újabb, korszerű kortárs esztétikával, aminek eszköztára -jelmeztervezése és színpadtechnikája- felejthetetlen és egyedülálló látványvilággal egészíti ki a produkciót, olyannal amilyet még soha nem láttunk. A Varázslat Cirque du Soleil-je, egy mókás este, ahol a showbiznisz találkozik a varázslattal ebben a fantasztikus műben. Végre Budapesten is megtekinthető lesz a világszerte már több millió embert elbűvölő attrakció.\n\nAz előadások mindig szórakoztatóak, néha megdöbbentőek és biztosítanak minket afelől, hogy megfelelnek a rájuk aggatott címkéknek, mintha ez egyfajta szuperhős csapat lenne. Az Illúzionisták azt akarja tenni a varázslatért, amit a Cirque du Soleil tett a cirkuszért. És mivel nincs kitömve pszeudo-misztikus kacatokkal a jó részek között, egy következetesebb produkciót nyújt.

You buy your ticket and plan your picnic, but one question remains: where will the evening unfold? Guests know the event will take place in BROOKLYN but the exact location is revealed the day of. The goal is be able to celebrate everything Brooklyn has to offer from parks, waterfronts, and urban skylines. \n\nDress Code! All white attire is the theme that pulls this summer evening gathering together but creativity is the only thing that's mandatory. We love to see hats, belts, accessories and more in the color of your choice. Be playful, be beautiful, be YOU!\n\nTabletop Décor! Your lovely tablescapes set the tone for a festive evening. This is outdoor dining in style. But your tables can be as simple or elaborate as you want. After setting up, guests wander the venue, wine glass in hand, to see what others have created and meet new people! \n\nThe Food! We believe sharing a meal is an expression of love. Everyone becomes a foodie for the night and goes all out in creating, preparing and packing their delicious menu to be shared amongst thousands of new friends. \n\nThe Wine! Since so much time and care went into creating the menu, it's certainly not an evening for ordinary vino and we want you to enjoy an event where you don't have to wait in line, or take out your wallet. Guests are encouraged to bring the wine/bubbles for their extravagant picnic.  *Please note: This event is 21 and older.\n\nEntertainment! Music is the soul of any party and PopUp Brooklyn is no different. You have no idea which musical artist might take the stage on June 2nd and we are keeping the secret! But with past guests including Talib Kweli and Darryl McDaniels of Run-DMC, you can be sure the music will get people out of their chairs. \n\n\n* The PopUp is a 21+ event. IDs will be strictly checked at the door. We apologize for the inconvenience.\n\n*Tables and chairs provided. Guests bring their own food and decor.\n\n*Tickets are non-refundable but are transferable.\n\n*Rain or shine we will dine!","distance":5519,"startTime":"2018-06-02T17:00:00-0400","endTime":"2018-06-02T22:00:00-0400","timezone":"America/New_York","updatedTime":"2017-08-30T04:11:45+0000","timeFromNow":11634641,"isCancelled":false,"isDraft":false,"category":"EVENT_FOOD","ticketing":{"ticket_uri":"https://popupbrooklyn2018.eventbrite.com/"},"place":{"id":"417239981762068","name":"Secret Location","location":{"city":"Brooklyn","country":"United States","latitude":40.652876,"longitude":-73.959494,"state":"NY"}},"stats":{"attending":2836,"declined":0,"maybe":19288,"noreply":3043},"distances":{"venue":5519,"event":6453},"venue":{"id":"1585675725062546","name":"Times Square, Manhattan, New York","about":"New York\n\nTimes Square is the denomination of the area formed in the confluence and crossing of two great avenues of the city of New York, the United States; Can be defined as a large square or wide, composed of several intersections and corne","emails":["reservations23hs@gmail.com"],"coverPicture":"https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/q82/s720x720/26232473_1767783183518465_3404241214322447345_o.jpg?oh=6e34dca0424ece32cf06b83ea73db2fa&oe=5AD95FAB","profilePicture":"https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-1/c58.0.200.200/p200x200/14203372_1585676198395832_2311636085941034136_n.jpg?oh=b8ab1eac79da568b1781efa0bab190b2&oe=5AF94033","category":"Landmark & Historical Place","categoryList":["Landmark & Historical Place","Performance & Event Venue","Sports & Recreation Venue"],"location":{"city":"New York","country":"United States","latitude":40.757627642546,"longitude":-73.985753059387,"state":"NY","street":"Times Square, Manhattan","zip":"10036"}}},{"id":"2004916129735996","name":"Taste of Times Square","type":"public","coverPicture":"https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/18486330_1457294924290568_7417477497561789356_n.jpg?oh=ad717c4a5f0fa3d8533aaf989d52aa2d&oe=5ADCAC2C","profilePicture":"https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/c153.0.200.200/p200x200/18486330_1457294924290568_7417477497561789356_n.jpg?oh=9833107845693e38698d751fd6320ae3&oe=5AF37D1D","description":"Check out their website for Updates & Info - http://www.timessquarenyc.org/events/taste-of-times-square/index.aspx\n\nTaste of Times Square\nMonday, June 5, 2017\n5:00 - 9:00 pm\n\nEnjoy a world of flavors from Times Square's top restaurants and live performances from a selection of New York City musicians.\n\nOver 40 of our best restaurants offer their finest tastes from around the globe at Taste of Times Square – our annual outdoor food and music festival.
